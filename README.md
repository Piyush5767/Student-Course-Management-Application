# Student-Course-Management-Application
Student Course Management Application - MEAN Stack

This application is built in Node, MongoDB, Express and Angular in which students add course in their section, drop a course and check number of course they have. I have also build small admin panel in which admin create new course, check  number of course student have and delete course. 
There is also signin and signup feature enable by using Passport Library.
